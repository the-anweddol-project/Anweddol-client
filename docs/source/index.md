## Global overview

Anweddol is a client/server system providing temporary, SSH-controllable virtual machines to enhance anonymity online.

Itâ€™s usefulness comes when someone wants to use a fully functional computer while being exposed to less dangers by using it remotely on a dedicated server, and by destroying it after use.
