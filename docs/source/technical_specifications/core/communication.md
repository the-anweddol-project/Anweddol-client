# Communication
---

In this section, you will learn about the different communications kinds and formats related to the Anweddol client.

## Format

Requests and responses sent between the client and the server are JSON structures.
	-> A widely used data format, cross-platform and easily manipulable.

Before sending anything to a peer, the size of the packet is sent in an 8 byte message, padded with '=' characters : 

| Message         | Length        | Padded message length       |
| --------------- | ------------- |---------------------------- |
| `"hello world"` | 11 characters | `"11======"` (8 characters) |

Thus, the native theorical maximum packet size is 99 999 999 bytes.

## Request format

Here is a typical request structure that a client will send : 

```
{
	"verb": VERB;
	"parameters": PARAMETERS
}
```

 -> `VERB` : Like an HTTP request, the verb depicts the action to execute on the server side. There is 3 natively supported verbs :

- `"CREATE"`
- `"DESTROY"`
- `"STAT"`

`"CREATE"` defines the intent to create a new container.
`"DESTROY"` defines the intent to destroy a previously created container.
`"STAT"` defines the intent to gather information about a server runtime.

-> `PARAMETERS` : This is the section reserved for any kind of parameters used to provide additional information in a request.

> Only the `"DESTROY"` request requires some parameters to authenticate the client (see the [Authentication](https://anweddol-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical_specifications/core/client_authentication.html) section to learn more).

## Response format

Here is a typical response structure that a client will receive : 

```
{
	"success": SUCCESS;
	"message": MESSAGE;
	"data": DATA
}
```

-> `SUCCESS` : The success defines the current state of the request on the server.
It is actually a boolean value (`True` or `False`) : 

- `True` : The request was successfully satisfied.
- `False` : There was an error during the processing of the request.

-> `MESSAGE` : The additional information coming along with the success of the response.
It can be anything that explains what happened on the server side (see the 'Error handling' point below).

-> `DATA` : The data section, reserved for returned parameters.

See the *Sanitization* section below to know how the data is sanitized on the client-side.

## Error handling

When an error occurs during the processing of a request on the server side, a message is set in the response explaining what's wrong. 

Here is a non-exhaustive list of status codes and their messages : 

|Message                | Meaning                                      |
|---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
|`"OK"`                 | The request was successfully satisfied       |
|`"Bad authentication"` | The sender specified invalid credentials     |
|`"Bad request"`        | The previous request was malformed           |
|`"Refused request"`    | The request was refused                      |
|`"Unavailable"`        | The server is currently unavailable          |
|`"Internal error"`     | The server is experiencing an internal error |

Note that messages depicting an error may come with an additional explanation of why the error occurred : 

```
"Bad request (reason : Unsupported or unknown verb)"
```

## Security

### Encryption

For security and integrity reasons, requests and responses are encrypted in AES 256 CBC.
Each AES key and Initialization Vectors are different for every client connection session.

RSA keys length is 4096 bytes. The RSA implementation is used to send the connection session AES key to the client securely.

Here is a visual example of how the keys are exchanged with a server : 

> Bold text mean RSA encrypted text

> '>'/'<' symbol means 'send' and 'o' symbol means 'receive'

| A | packet content   | B |
|---|------------------|---|
|>  | connexion        |o  |
|>  | A RSA public key |o  |
|o  | validation       |<  |
|o  | B RSA public Key |<  |
|>  | validation       |o  |
|>  | **A AES Key**    |o  |
|o  | validation       |<  |
|o  | **B AES Key**    |<  |
|>  | validation       |o  | 

*'->' symbol means 'send'  and 'o' symbol means 'receive'* 

### Sanitization

Requests and responses are sanitized upon sending and receiving at each end.
Here is the raw [Cerberus](https://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/index.html) validation scheme used to verify the format and content :

```
